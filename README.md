# VSD
VLSI System Design is a modelling of integrated circuits by combining millions of transistors into a single chip. The main aim is to design a system with optimal cost, low power consumptin, high performance.

# RISC-v 
REDUCED INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture. This customizable instruction set architecture is rebuilding the world of microprocessors with its flexibility to design the microprocessors of their need.

# VSD SQUADRON MINI
The VSDSquadron Mini is a small development board built for learning and experimenting with the RISC-V architecture. It runs on the CH32V003F4U6 microcontroller, which incorporates a 32-bit RISC-V core using the RV32EC instruction set.
